My next holiday plan is to visit Sharm El Sheikh with my family. Because I'm under eighteen. My family members are me, my mother and my father. We will go by plane. We will visit beautiful places. example sohp square, mustafa mosque etc. We can eat famous dishes in Sarm El Sheikh, camel meat it is very interesting. We will return home by plane in 4 days. So I'm waiting impatiently
