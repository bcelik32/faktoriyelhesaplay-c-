My next holiday plan is to visit Sharm El Sheikh with my family. Because I'm under eighteen. My family members are me, my mother and my father. We will go by plane. We will visit beautiful places. example sohp square, mustafa mosque etc. We can eat famous dishes in Sarm El Sheikh, camel meat it is very interesting. We will return home by plane 4 days later. So I'm waiting impatiently


I want to talk about what will happen if we do not protect our water resources.  First of all, there are water shortages and agriculture cannot be done.  Then water wars break out and epidemics increase.  and the world's population decreases.  So we must protect our water resources.
